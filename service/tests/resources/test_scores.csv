The terms under which these uses can occur are clearly identified to prevent misunderstandings that could jeopardize final publication of a manuscript (Section II, Permitted Uses by Authors).

    The new agreement clarifies that the transfer of copyright in Supporting Information is nonexclusive. Authors may use or authorize the use of Supporting Information in which they hold copyright for any purpose and in any format (Section I, Copyright).

    The new agreement extends key terms of use to author's previously published work with ACS – as long as the same conditions of use are met (Section III, Retained and Other Rights).

Readers' right inferred, but not stated explicitly, by the hybrid open access and subscription policies",14,http://authors.acm.org/main.html," Reuse

    Authors can reuse any portion of their own work in a new work of their own (and no fee is expected) as long as a citation and DOI pointer to the Version of Record in the ACM Digital Library are included.

        Contributing complete papers to any edited collection of reprints for which the author is not the editor, requires permission and usually a republication fee.

    Authors can include partial or complete papers of their own (and no fee is expected) in a dissertation as long as citations and DOI pointers to the Versions of Record in the ACM Digital Library are included.

    Authors have the option to choose the level of rights management they prefer. ACM offers three different options for authors to manage the publication rights to their work.

        Authors who want ACM to manage the rights and permissions associated with their work, which includes defending against improper use by third parties, can use ACM’s traditional copyright transfer agreement.
        Authors who prefer to retain copyright of their work can sign an exclusive licensing agreement, which gives ACM the right but not the obligation to defend the work against improper use by third parties.
        Authors who wish to retain all rights to their work can choose ACM’s author-pays option, which allows for perpetual open access through the ACM Digital Library.
